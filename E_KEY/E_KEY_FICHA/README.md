## E_KEY_FICHA (Tag)
It allows the programming of Escornabot using printed or cut-out cards (cardboard ..) communicating the commands via Bluetooth 
using @arduino Nano, easy to print, manageable and expandable to 15 "Tabs" thanks to the firmware of @caligari_pub.

## Number of Tags (Fichas)
To use six tags we need the PCBs E_KEY_T_1_V and E_KEY_T_2_V the latter with the power components.

 If we want to have more chips (9 to 15) we will put intermediate circuits E_KEY_T_2_V without the power supply electronics.

The selection will always be configured on the end plates, according to the firmware "configuration.h".
