## Catalog
- [Escorna CPU][CPU01] is 50x50mm to 50x100mm board to use with Arduino Nano. It integrates keypad on board on 2x

- [Escorna_CPU_2_4][CPU240] It is a pcb that integrates an ATmega328P, a step-up (to use 1.2V batteries) and the rest of the electronics needed to build an Escornabot.

- [Arduino Shield][ARD01] is an Arduino Uno compatible
  shield ready to use with the Escornabot's motors and also integrates a keypad.

- [Cervus][CER01] is a board based on powerful ATmega32u4
  microcontroler and compatible with Arduino shields.
- [E_Keypad][KEY01] Is a 50x50mm board with 6  and 5 buttons and
  connects to any Escornabot.

- [E_KEY_BT][E_KEY_BT] Escornabot keyboard with MakeyMakey type sensors on the E_KEY_BT board.
   Any object that is minimally conductive can be used. Adjusting the value
   threshold: higher for less sensitivity, nothing needs to be changed in the
   robot firmware.

- [E_KEY_FICHA][E_KEY_FICHA] It allows the programming of Escornabot using printed or cut-out cards (cardboard ..) communicating the commands via Bluetooth.
  using @arduino Nano, easy to print, manageable and expandable to 15 "Tabs" thanks to the firmware of @caligari_pub

- [escoRnaFID][RnaFID]PCB for the project for children with visual impairment or blindness,
  developed by Angel Villanueva [@avilmaru][@avil] to control an Escornabot with RFID cards
